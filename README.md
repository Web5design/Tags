Tagging files with Alfred and Openmeta. 

It's working.
It's ugly. 

# Usage

## Tagging
Find file(s) with Alfred, run *Select files to tag* file action, type tags. 

Workflow **copies files paths to clipboard**, then opens Alfred and types *tag* keyword using AppleScript. 
That's that ugly part. 

## Showing tags
Find file, run *Show tags* file action. 

## Searching
Search for files tagged with given tag using tags keyword. 

# Requirements
- Openmeta cli is in /usr/bin
- path to Alfred is /Applications/Alfred 2.app

(ofc. that can be modified)
