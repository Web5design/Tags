Tagging files with Alfred 2 and Openmeta. 

# Usage #

- select files to tag using *Select files to tag* file action
- Alfred will reopen itself with *tag* script filter and show selected files with their tags
- then you can type tags to add or remove from files
- to add press ↩, to remove ⌥+↩	
- you can check tags of file using *Show tags* file action
- use *clearselection* keyword to clear selection(!)

Workflow no longer uses clipboard to store selected files and obeys workflow best practices.  It's better than before.

# Requirements #

- installed openmeta, path to it can be changes in openmeta.py
